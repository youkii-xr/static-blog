## The Idea
I've always wondered what happens behind the scenes of those cool challenges where people build amazing prototypes in days. My **ADHD** tells me I can do that too - everything will work perfectly on the first try, and if it doesn't, I'm a **complete failure**

Lately, I've been following all news in XR and AI. I am so excited for what is coming but **sooo overwhelmed** at the same time. A lot of stuff to learn, a lot of demos to work on, and **constantly feeling behind**

When I start a prototype, I **overthink everything** - complex features, refining every detail - till I get overwhelmed and the project join **THE PROJECTS ARCHIVE** (I think I have hit a new record of random uncompleted ideas now)

I will be mainly developing for **Meta Quest 3** using **Unity**

### Challenge Goals
- Sharpen my skills in quick prototyping
- Overcome perfectionism
- Accept failure
- Remember why I fell in love with XR in the first place, working on new ideas without stress or feeling overwhelmed
- Have a Work/Life balance in the process, meaning no late nights, taking breaks when needed, remember to eat and not live off coffee

### Why Now?
I'm recovering from a burnout. I need to prove to myself that I can share small wins without overthinking every detail

I've spent months on complex XR systems, solving technical problems most users won't notice and in the process I lost the ability to **prototype fast, fail fast, and enjoy trying new ideas without overthinking**

Also, I'm doing **XRCC hackathon** at the end of this month, so this is a good practice for me

### Building in Public
During this challenge, I am building in public sharing every **moment of progress, failure, frustration, learning** hoping that it helps people like me feel better about themselves

I am also stepping out of my comfort zone and starting to create **XR Content** and **engagging more** in the XR community

### My current state
A full time Computer Engineering Student, have a couple of freelance projects I am working on, recovering from a burnout, have a long list of new tech to learn, and trying to have a healthier life (less coffee, eating healthy and exercising more)

Participating in XRCC at the end of this month, being a NASA Space App Virtual Mentor and having my mid-term exams at the end of this month as well

Not sure if this challenge is a good idea, but a much needed experiment to try new things and fail / learn in new ways

## Day 0 : Getting Ready
I had the idea late in the afternoon with only a couple of hours to prepare. Of course I put a long list of things to do that I will need about 10 copies of me to finish. 

**BUT**, focused on finishing the most important stuff, setting up simple systems (a notebook, pen, and digital Kanban board) to help me. Created my digital page for tracking the challenge progress while I work.

**Highlights of stuff I actually did**

- [x] writing explicit challenge **guidelines**, **realistic goals** (*of course I had help from Ai cause I have unrealistic expectations about me*)
- [x] gathered some XR demos ideas that I wanted to work on (*saved Linkedin posts , ideas I had*) and filtered them

- [x] putting a basic plan about which platforms to publish on, setting a template to avoid being overwhelmed and keep documenting the process

- [x] spent some time panicking, overthinking, doubting but managed to overcome that

**didn't finish all the tasks, but at least I took action**

## Day 1: Panick Mode On
**CHALLENGE OFFICIALLY STARTED**
Have a busy day today: College, Online XRAI sessions about OpenCV, and meal prepping but still will try to work on the 1st demo a little

**I have a confession**, I choose an easy demo that I had previously started working on but didn't finish, so I know how to exactly do it. But that's fine I need an easy thing to start with to not get overwhelmed.

**Demo: MR Wall Color Changer** It was a fast POC requested in one of my freelance jobs but didn't make it to a prototype but I liked the idea of seeing how my room will look before actually painting it

That is the video of the POC I worked on:
