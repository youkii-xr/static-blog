Hey There! 👋 I am **Salma** (aka **Youkii** 🐈‍⬛)

I'm currently pursuing a **Computer Engineering Bachaleor** and work as a **freelance XR Developer**

In my free time I like tinkering with different stuff, from **electronics** and **MCU** to **crafts** and **mechanical** projects. I just like connecting different stuff together and see how it works 👩‍🔧

Everything you see on this website - the design, the layout, the portfolio - I built, I like to have my personal touch on my stuff ✨

## Some Facts about Me 😺
- I am a **visual learner** that is why you will see lots of images, graphs and images in this blog to keep you (and me) hooked
- I looooove **coffee** ☕ (who don't?)
- I am a **cat mommy** 🐈‍⬛ of six adorable cats
- I am a certified overthinking and perfectionist (which sometimes holds me back but I am trying to overcome that)
- You'll always find me excited about trying new stuff, new ideas and always experimenting with something 
- I enjoy **explaining and teaching** , from simplifying hard tech & engineering concepts to conducting workshops

## My Journey in XR Development
It all started with a VR Diploma I signed up for (as part of the other many random workshops I sign for to learn new stuff)

**But.. this one was different**, after jumping around in many tech fields, I felt like finding **The One**

The idea of creating your own worlds, where the only limit is you, was just fascinating!

After finishing the VR Diploma. I continued my **self-learning** journy through **Youtube Tutorials**, **Documentations** and many many **trial and errors** (and lots of coffee to solve these errors)

I started my own mini bootcamp in my bedroom (spending around 12 hours a day) for 3 months just learning about Unity and XR, working on projects, learning advanced C#

And **Got my first freelance job!** and since then, I decided that I want to have a career as an XR developer

## Why This Blog Exists ❓
I've spent countless hours (and way too many cups of coffee) figuring things out the hard way. So I figured — why not share what I've learned?

There are some awesome developers in the XR community whose tutorials saved me ton of time. I want to be part of helping people this way

**Here's what you'll find** 👓
- **XR tutorials for all levels**
- **Open-source tools & plugins**
- **tips & tricks** that will save you time, frustration and help you build better 
- **Project breakdowns & devlogs**
- **Wild experiences** by mixing XR, AI, custom hardware and other random ideas
- **Bilingual content** - Tutorials in both **English** and **Arabic**
- just some random facts, fun ideas, and new personal experiments
I'm building in public, sharing the messy process, not just the published final polished project

## Want see what I've Built? 👀

Check out the events I attended and all the great memories I made in my [gallery](https://youkii-xr.github.io/gallery.html)

## Let's Connect! 🤝
I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects, discuss XR development, or just chat about wild ideas over virtual coffee
